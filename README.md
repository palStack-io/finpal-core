## The Story Behind finPal

**finPal started as Dollar Dollar Bill Y'all** - and it started with roommates arguing over who paid for pizza.

You know the drill: someone buys groceries, someone else pays rent, a third person covers utilities. By month's end, nobody knows who owes what. Spreadsheets get messy. Group chats fill with "did I pay you back?" messages. Friendships get awkward over $20.

One of us got tired of it and built **Dollar Dollar Bill Y'all**. Simple goal: track who owes whom, settle up, move on with life. No bank connections, no subscriptions, no data harvesting. Just math and fairness.

**Then it worked. Really well.**

Friends started using it. Then those friends' friends. People we'd never met were running it on their servers to split bills with their roommates.

And the feature requests kept coming:
- "Can it track my budget too?"
- "What about my investment portfolio?"
- "SimpleFin for automatic bank sync?"
- "Can we use this for our monthly dinner club expenses?"

Each request made sense. Each solved a real problem. So we kept building.

The codebase grew. The vision expanded. What started as roommate bill-splitting became a full financial management platform. We realized we'd outgrown both the name and the original architecture.

**Dollar Dollar Bill Y'all evolved into finPal.**

Complete rewrite. Modern stack. All the features people kept asking for: budgeting, investment tracking, bank sync, enhanced bill-splitting. We kept what worked (privacy-first, self-hosted, no tracking) and built everything else around it.

**But finPal isn't the endgame—it's the foundation.**

Our ultimate goal is **debtFree**: a gamified debt payoff platform with financial literacy at its core. Think progress bars that actually motivate you. Achievements for paying off credit cards. Educational content that doesn't feel like homework. Community challenges that make debt reduction social and supportive.

finPal is teaching us what people need for financial management. debtFree will take those lessons and laser-focus them on the debt crisis millions face. Financial literacy shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or boring textbooks—it should be built into the tools you use daily.

**The Roadmap:**
```
Dollar Dollar Bill Y'all (2023) - Roommate bill-splitting
    ↓
finPal (2024-2025) - Complete financial management
    ↓
debtFree (Future) - Gamified debt payoff + financial literacy
```

finPal is where we learn. debtFree is where we focus that knowledge on helping people escape debt.

**The Privacy Stand**
Every mainstream money app wants your bank credentials, tracks every purchase, and monetizes your spending patterns. We built the opposite: a financial platform that respects your privacy because it literally can't access what it doesn't collect.

**Learning Through Building**
None of us came from fintech backgrounds. We learned secure financial data handling, bank APIs, multi-currency systems, and compliance stuff as we built. AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen) helped us learn faster, but every line gets human review.

finPal is now part of **palStack**—our collection of privacy-first tools. From roommate debt tracking to complete financial management, all without selling your data.

**Legacy Note:** The [original Dollar Dollar Bill Y'all repository](https://github.com/harung1993/dollardollar) is still there for anyone who just needs the simpler bill-splitting focus.
